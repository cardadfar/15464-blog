         <p>Watching the baked good simulation was really fun. On a side note, the previous day I had gotten into a long discussion about bread with a friend, so it was amusing to come to class and still end up talking about bread. I'm curious as to how much of the chemistry is actually simulated in baking (since we don't see the inside of the bread baking, we don't have to worry about rending any of that, but I'd be curious to see a cross-section like animation).</p>
