         <p>I was only active for the first half of class, so I got to see a lot of really cool Miniproject 2 demos. I was surprised to see one student constantly change his mesh simulation parameters and still result in a stable mesh. Our own project was very sensitive to parameter changes and could easily blow up. I didn't pay attention to the integrator they used, although it could be possible that they wrote their integrator a more stable way. Either way I was really impressed.</p>
