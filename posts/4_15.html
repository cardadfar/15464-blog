         <p>Hodgin's example of procedural animation of lococomotion using no hand animation or cleanup was interesting to watch. She makes a good point that there's a lot to learn from robotic kinematics, especially for ubiquitous tasks like walking and hopping/jumping. The rendering was done a while ago, and while graphics algorithms have improved drastically, I'd like to see the same algorithm applied to much higher quality rigs and have people see if they notice it was procedurally generated motions or not.</p>
