        <p>Most of the integrators we covered today were actually a review from a computational physics course I took before (we covered verlet, leapfrog, and RK4). In computer graphics, its interesting how we teach students forward and symplectic euler without teaching backwards euler (many students would get confused thinking symplectic = backwards). The Nvidia simulations we watched towards the end of class were extremely entertaining, and I would never guess how advanced particle-based simulations could be (I know they're embarrassingly parallel, but didn't expect such good realtime performance from them).</p>
