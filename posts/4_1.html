         <p>After looking at the rigid body deformables today, I was wondering how these tools peformed different than blend skinning algirthims we saw in a previous class. I'm under the impression that rigid body deformations try to maintain the tesselation gemoetry, but am not sure why that is an important constraint to maintain. The paper that was able to simulate a lot of rigid bodies in real time very quickly using openMP was really impressive. I'm currently taking 15-418 and have recently been interested in the parallel side of graphics and animation, but am finding that a lot of these algorithms are embarassingly parallel, which isn't much of a challenge to parallelize.</p>
