        <p>There have been a lot of really interesting advancements in motion capture parsing that we learned of today. Most of these were concerned with applying the same 12 Principles of Animation, which is the same approach my partner and I originally planned on taking for the MoCap Parsing assignment. The Encoding-based approach taught at the end of class was definitely the most interesting, and while it may be very expensive to compute and require a lot of training data, I could see it integrated into video games in the future when more data becomes available.</p>
