         <p>It was interesting today to see how particle-based fluid simulations paralleled particle-based cloth simulations. I wonder how similar a particle mesh and particle fluid would be given that the same timestep-integration technique is used for both of them. It makes sense for some of these operations that they use a convolution kernel to get different particle properties (which is faster and highly parallizable), since neighboring particles most influence a particles force and density parameters. At the end of class it was fun to see the learning-based approach of fluids. Is the learning part trying to learn the optimal fluid hyperparameters given a pre-existing fluid simulation, or to create a fluid simulation from scratch?</p>
