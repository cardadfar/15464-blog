         <p>Most of the papers we looked about today were about generating and simulating hair. I found the paper about painting on hair to be particularly interesting, yet since they would try to fit strokes to one of the hair presets, I am wondering how diverse an array of hairstyles you could actually design? It seems that a lot of the same long brushstrokes would map to long straight hair, so how would you model other properties of hair (such as curl and thickness).</p>
